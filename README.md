Project title: 
Bookwork

Summary of the project: 
Resource to list your used textbooks for sale or exchange. Sellers will have the option to mark a textbook as for sale, for exchange, or both. Buyers will be able to look through listings as well as post wanted books at desired prices. These wanted listings can be accepted at the buyer’s desired price or negotiated.

A brief tour (in English) of the site, from the viewpoint of a typical user:
A typical user can sign-up for an account and browse through, or post, listings for used textbooks. The website will be setup to be accessible as possible, a prototype of the visuals is in the works.

A description of what you expect to be the greatest difficulty in the project:
I expect a challenge on how to setup the payment system in textbook sales, i.e how to get money from the buyer to the seller. I am exploring options of making it venmo/cash only or doing paypal transactions. I most likely will just do a basic payment implementation such as venmo/cash to avoid overcomplicating things.

A description of the "minimum deliverable entity": what you should really plan to do at a minimum:
At minimum, the website will be as described in the summary minus the buyer’s wanted-post capabilities. Users will be able to at minimum browse a catalogue of user posted textbooks.

A description of any optional features, which you can do if you have enough time:
I would like to explore the option of creating a database of all textbooks used in UCSC to make selecting/ identifying textbooks more accessible, as well as make it possible to buy textbooks by also looking up certain classes. I also might just implement a simple ISBN lookup as a bare minimum.

A description of how do you plan to divide roles or tasks among team members:
I am working on this project as a solo member but if things change, I will make the appropriate announcements and acknowledgements. At present I plan on creating a roadmap as well as deadlines for certain website functionality.
